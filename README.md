This repository contains Python codes for paper:
Calibration of cellular automata urban growth models from urban genesis onwards - a novel application of Markov chain Monte Carlo approximate Bayesian computation.
The two .py files are codes for a Constained Cellular Automata model and its calibration method - MCMC-ABC.
The jupyter notebook demonstrates the usage of the CCA and MCMC-ABC functions.
