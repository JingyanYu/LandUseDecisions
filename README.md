1. Calibration of cellular automata urban growth models from urban genesis onwards - a novel application of Markov chain Monte Carlo approximate Bayesian computation
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2021.101689
2. A data-driven framework to manage uncertainty due to limited transferability in urban growth models https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2022.101892

The research involves using 
* a constrained cellular automata model CCA to model urban expansion, 
* a Markov chain Monte Carlo Approximate Bayesian Computation to calibration model parameters,
* clustering of urban growth modes (parameter clusters) from extrapolated parameters,
* using the urban growth modes (parameter clusters) to classify/characterize urban spatial developments.
